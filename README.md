# Dog-Breed-Identification-System
Built an image classification model to accurately identify various dog breeds using Transfer Learning
with ResNet50V2 architecture. The project involved detailed data preprocessing, augmentation, model training
on a labelled dataset, and performance evaluation. Achieved high accuracy on real-world images, demonstrating
effective use of CNN-based deep learning techniques for dog breed identification.
